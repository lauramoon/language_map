Maps of languages spoken in the United States, Illinois, and Pennsylvania using Leaflet

These maps show the most common language spoken at home excluding English and Spanish for each state (on the U.S. map) and for each Public Use Microdata Area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (for Illinois and Pennsylvania), with language data taken from the 2018 American Community Survey.

When a region is clicked, a control on the left lists all languages spoken by more than 100 people in the region with the population percentage.

Future work includes:
1) Adding additional states
2) Figuring out how to elegantly reset the info box on the left
3) Creating a new map showing data for a single selected language (either number of speakers or percentage of population)
