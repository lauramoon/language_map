map of languages spoken in Illinois using Leaflet

This map shows the most common language spoken at home excluding English and Spanish for each Public Use Microdata Area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, with language data taken from the 2018 American Community Survey.

Future work includes:
1) Adding additional states
2) Showing additional most common languages for each region when selected
